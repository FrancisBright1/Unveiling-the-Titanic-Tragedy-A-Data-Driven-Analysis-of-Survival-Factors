# Unveiling the Titanic Tragedy: A Data-Driven Analysis of Survival Factors

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the Titanic dataset to uncover trends and key factors affecting survival rates. By using various data analysis techniques, we explore the impact of factors such as class, gender, and age on survival rates.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and converted categorical variables to numerical ones.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Explored the distribution of variables and their relationships.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Identified key factors affecting survival.
4. **Visualizations**: Created visual representations of the findings.

## Key Findings
- **Class Matters**: First-class passengers had a significantly higher survival rate.
- **Gender Differences**: Women had a higher survival rate than men.
- **Age Factor**: Younger passengers had higher survival rates.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For analysis and visualization
